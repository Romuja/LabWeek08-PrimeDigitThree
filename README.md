# LabWeek08 - PrimeDigitThree

##  Description
The Java program solves the Lab08 task using Java's built-in `LinkedList`. It performs the following steps:

1. Generates all prime numbers from 0 to `n` (where `n < 1,000,000`)
2. Stores them in a singly linked list (`LinkedList<Integer>`)
3. Filters out primes that contain the digit `'3'` into a second list
4. Calculates and prints the sum of the second list
